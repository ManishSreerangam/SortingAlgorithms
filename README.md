# Efficiency Of an Algorithm
<p> Before understanding sorting algorithms there is a need to understand how efficiency of an algorithm is calculated. The efficiency of an algorithm is computed by calculating its usage of resources. We consider 2 resources as primary. 
<ol>
<li> Time - Time required to execute an algorith. </li>
<li> Space - Amount of memory used by an algorith </li> </ol> 
Here i am focussing on the resource "TIme". The rate at which running time of an agorithm increases w.r.t increase in volume of data is called order of growth of an algorithm . This "Order of growth" is defined by using a "BIG O " notation 
</p>

| Order of Growth | BIG-O Notation |
| --- | --- |
| constant | O(1) |
| Logarithmic | O( log n ) |
| Linear | O(n) |
| Quadratic | O(n^2) |
| Cubic | O(n^3) |
| Exponential | O(2^n) , O(10^n) |
<p> To understand the above table, let us consider the case of linear order of growth for which the BIG O notation is O(n) what does that mean? which means as the amount of data increases the time taken for the algorithm / number of iterations taken for the algorithm to execute increases linearly.</p>

# Sorting Algorithm
<p> Sorting algorithms are used to sort the data in a particular order. There are various algorithms available to sort the data </p>
<ol> 
  <li> Bubble Sort </li>
  <li> Insertion Sort </li>
  <li> Selection Sort </li>
  <li> Shell Sort </li>
  <li> Merge Sort</li>
  <li> Quick Sort </li>
  <li> Heap sort </li>
</ol>
<p> Selecting best algorithm for a problem depends on execution time, storage space, Programming effort </p>
